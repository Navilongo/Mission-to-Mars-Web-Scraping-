# web-scraping-challenge

## Mission to Mars

In this week's activity, we are to put into practice the things we have learned using flask, Mongo and brief web scraping. 

To showcase our progress, we image that we have been hired to assist in preparing a presentation of the Mars landscape in the form of a web scrape html. 

The way that this works, users would be able to access our flask hosted html site which includes a single button that will scrape 4 different pages to 
obtain everythign you may need to know about Mars:

  - Images of the Hemispheres
  - Important Statistics
  - Most up-to-date news on the planet
  - And a featured image of Mars
